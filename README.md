a basic sim for quadcopter drones.

I will start as simple as possible and increase complexity as time goes on. I will work from a 1D sim, where the drone can only move vertically and the only forces are gravity and the thrust from the drone, to a 2D sim, to a 3D sim.

The 1D sim is complete, and can be found in 1d-sim.py

I will now begin working on the 2D sim. The 2D sim will require us to consider:
1. vertical motion (same as 1D)
2. horizontal motion (new)
3. rolling/angular motion (also new)
